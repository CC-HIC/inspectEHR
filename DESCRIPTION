Description: This package helps to produce data quality reports for CC-HIC.
    This consists of data wrangling, cleaning, verification and validation.
    There are a lot of helper functions that have been written to facilitate
    data wrangling and cleaning. These need to be separated and ported to
    cleanEHR in due course.
