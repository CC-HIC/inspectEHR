Title: Data Quality Reporting and Validation for CC-HIC
Version: 0.5
Author: Edward Palmer
Maintainer: Edward Palmer <edward.palmer@ucl.ac.uk>
Description: This package helps to produce data quality reports for CC-HIC.
    It is designed to be run inside the data safe-haven at UCL and as such
    might not function correctly outside this environment. There are a lot
    of helper functions that have been written to facilitate data wrangling
    as part of my PhD. These need to be separated and ported to cleanEHR
    in due course.
