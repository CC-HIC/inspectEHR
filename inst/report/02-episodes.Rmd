# Episode Profiles {#episodes}

Table \@ref(tab:spells) shows the number of admissions (in spells and episodes) for each site.

```{r spells, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(spells, caption = "patients, episodes and spells in the CC-HIC cohort")
```

The following plots show the admission profiles for each site. They are based upon admission timings only (a mandatory field for episode creation within the database), and so they create a visual representation of all episodes within the database over time. Missing data is visible as grey cells representing a day with "no patients admitted".

```{r admission_plots, results="asis", echo = FALSE}
root <- "./_bookdown_files/plots/"

    cat("### Admission Plots  \n")
      for (i in seq_along(all_sites)) {
        cat("![](", root, "episodes/", all_sites[i], "_admissions.png)  \n", sep = "")
      }
rm(i)
```
